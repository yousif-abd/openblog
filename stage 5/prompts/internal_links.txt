You are an SEO expert. Embed these internal links naturally into the article sections.

AVAILABLE LINKS:
{links_text}

ARTICLE SECTIONS:
{sections_text}

RULES:
- Add 3-5 links total across all sections
- Use natural anchor text (NOT "click here", NOT the full URL)
- Spread links across DIFFERENT sections
- Don't link the same URL twice
- The "find" text must be an EXACT, COMPLETE phrase from the section (copy-paste exactly)
- Keep anchor text concise (2-5 words) but COMPLETE (no partial words!)
- Only link phrases that naturally relate to the target page topic
- IMPORTANT: Double-check that your "find" text exists EXACTLY in the section content
- Do NOT truncate words - use complete phrases only

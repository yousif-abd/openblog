These URLs are dead/broken and need replacements:

{urls_list}

Topic: {keyword}

CRITICAL: You MUST use Google Search to find REAL, WORKING replacement URLs.
- Search for each topic and ONLY return URLs that appear in your search results
- DO NOT make up or guess URLs - they will be verified and rejected if they don't exist
- If you cannot find a working replacement via search, OMIT that URL from the response

IMPORTANT - Source preferences (in order):
1. Industry blogs and publications (TechCrunch, Wired, The Verge, company blogs)
2. Reputable news outlets (Forbes, Business Insider, CNBC)
3. Official product/company pages
4. Well-known tech publications (Ars Technica, ZDNet, VentureBeat)

AVOID:
- Academic papers (arxiv.org, IEEE, ACM) - too technical for blog readers
- Wikipedia - not authoritative enough
- Social media posts
- Forums (Reddit, Stack Overflow)

Each replacement should:
1. Cover the same or similar topic as the original
2. Be accessible and readable for a general audience
3. Have current/up-to-date information

CRITICAL - Generate anchor_text that flows naturally in the sentence:
- Look at the "Context" showing the original sentence
- The anchor_text REPLACES the text inside <a>...</a>
- Read the result out loud - it must sound natural

Example context: "According to a study at <a href=\"...\">Example Research</a>, teams..."
- WRONG anchor_text: "GitHub" -> "According to a study at GitHub, teams..." (awkward)
- WRONG anchor_text: "a recent study" -> "According to a study at a recent study, teams..." (redundant)
- CORRECT anchor_text: "GitHub's research" -> "According to a study at GitHub's research, teams..." (flows naturally)

RESPOND WITH JSON (note anchor_text examples):
{{
    "replacements": [
        {{
            "old_url": "https://example-dead-link.com/study",
            "new_url": "https://github.blog/research-copilot-productivity",
            "source_name": "GitHub Blog",
            "anchor_text": "GitHub's productivity research",
            "reason": "Comprehensive study on AI code review impact"
        }}
    ]
}}

More anchor_text examples that flow naturally:
- "GitHub's latest findings" (not just "GitHub")
- "research from Microsoft" (not just "Microsoft")
- "a Stripe engineering report" (not just "Stripe")

For URLs with no good replacement, omit from the replacements array.

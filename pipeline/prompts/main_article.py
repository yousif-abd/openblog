*** TASK ***
You are writing a long-form blog post in {company_name}'s voice, fully optimized for LLM discovery, on the topic defined by **Primary Keyword**.

*** CONTENT RULES ***

1. Word count: {standards["word_count_target"]} words (MINIMUM {standards["min_word_count"]}) – keep storyline tight, info-dense.

2. Headline: EXACTLY 50-60 characters (count each character). If headline exceeds 60 chars, shorten it. Every character counts. Subtitle: 80-100 characters. Teaser: 2-3 sentences with a HOOK (compelling question, surprising stat, or relatable pain point).

3. Direct_Answer: 45-55 words exactly (count words), featured snippet optimized, with one citation [1] naturally embedded. Must be 45-55 words exactly for AEO scoring.

4. Intro: 200-300 words total. Opening paragraph (80-120 words) with STORY/HOOK (real scenario, surprising insight, or question) + key takeaways (3-4 bullet points).

5. New H2 every 250-300 words; headings packed with natural keywords. Each H2 MUST be followed by at least 2-3 paragraphs of real content. NEVER create headings followed only by citations.

6. Every paragraph ≤ 30 words & ≥ 90% active voice, and **must contain** a number, KPI or real example.

7. **Primary Keyword** "{primary_keyword}" must appear **naturally** in first 100 words and **EXACTLY 5-8 times** throughout entire article (for 1-1.5% density). **CRITICAL**: Count the exact phrase "{primary_keyword}" only. Before finalizing JSON, count exact phrase occurrences. If count ≠ 5-8, adjust content. Do NOT include keyword in FAQ/PAA sections when counting main content mentions. **MANDATORY**: After writing, count keyword mentions. If count > 8, remove excess mentions. If count < 5, add more. Use semantic variations (LSI keywords) for remaining mentions.

8. **NEVER** embed PAA, FAQ or Key Takeaways inside sections, section titles, intro or teaser; they live in separate JSON keys. FAQ/PAA quality affects AEO score - make them specific and valuable.

9. **Internal links**: MINIMUM {standards["internal_links_min"]} throughout article, woven seamlessly into sentences. Example: `<a href="/target-slug">Descriptive Anchor</a>` (≤ 6 words, varied). ENSURE correct HTML format.
   • **BATCH LINKING**: If Internal Links section contains batch sibling articles (same batch_id), prioritize linking to them within article content. Link to batch siblings naturally in 2-3 sections where contextually relevant. This creates article clusters and improves SEO.
   • **VERIFICATION**: Before finalizing, count internal links - must be at least {standards["internal_links_min"]}.

10. Citations in-text as [1], [2]… matching the **Sources** list. MINIMUM {standards["citation_count"]} sources. **CRITICAL**: Citations MUST be embedded within sentences, NEVER as standalone paragraphs. Example: "Industry data shows 65% growth [1][2]." NOT "[1][2]" as a separate paragraph.

11. Highlight 1-2 insights per section with `<strong>…</strong>` (never `**…**`).

12. In **2-4 sections**, insert either an HTML bulleted (`<ul>`) or numbered (`<ol>`) list **introduced by one short lead-in sentence**; 4-8 items per list.

13. **RESEARCH DEPTH** (CRITICAL for 9/10+ quality):
    • Include MINIMUM {standards["data_points_min"]} specific statistics/data points throughout article (percentages, growth rates, market sizes, survey results). Each stat must include source [N].
    • Include MINIMUM {standards["case_studies_min"]} concrete case studies with company names, specific results, and timeframes. Example: "Airbnb increased conversions by 25% in Q3 2024 using this approach [3]."
    • Include MINIMUM {standards["examples_min"]} specific examples with named companies/products/tools. NO generic examples like "Company X" or "one business". Examples must be verifiable and current.
    • Ban vague claims - replace "many companies" with "67% of Fortune 500 companies [1]", replace "significant growth" with "40% year-over-year growth [2]".

14. **ORIGINALITY & UNIQUE INSIGHTS** (CRITICAL for standout content):
    • Include MINIMUM {standards["unique_insights_min"]} unique perspectives that readers won't find elsewhere. Use phrases like "surprisingly", "contrary to popular belief", "overlooked aspect", "hidden truth".
    • Add at least ONE contrarian view or myth-busting section challenging conventional wisdom.
    • Avoid these BANNED generic AI phrases: "in today's digital age", "it's no secret that", "in conclusion", "last but not least", "needless to say", "at the end of the day".
    • Inject thought leadership - what would an expert with 10+ years experience say that beginners wouldn't know?

15. **ENGAGEMENT & STORYTELLING**:
    • Use "you/your" at least 15 times throughout article for direct reader engagement.
    • Include 2-3 rhetorical questions in different sections to engage readers.
    • Vary sentence structure - mix short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones.
    • End every section with one bridging sentence that naturally sets up the next section (narrative flow).

16. Write as an industry expert with 10+ years experience. Include specific regulations, dates, and technical details. Provide actionable advice that only experts would know. Expert-level content (E-E-A-T) required for high AEO scores.

17. **COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATION** (if competitors provided):
    • If competitors list is not "none", add subtle differentiation by mentioning what sets {company_name} approach apart.
    • Example: "While traditional providers focus on X, {company_name} prioritizes Y for better results."
    • Do NOT trash talk competitors - maintain professional tone while highlighting unique value.

18. **Grammar & Capitalization**: Before finalizing, scan entire article for these exact errors. Proofread for grammar, spelling, punctuation. Capitalize proper nouns (Gartner, Nielsen, API, etc.) and sentence starts. Every sentence must start with a capital letter. Check: "improving" → "Improving", "here's" → "Here's". Avoid awkward phrases: "Here's clients" → "Here's how clients", "You can automation" → "Automation". **CRITICAL**: Search for "aI" or "a I" and replace ALL instances with "AI" (capitalized). Common errors to avoid: "speed upd"→"speed up", "applys"→"applies", "simplifys"→"simplifies", "enableing"→"enabling", "aPI"→"API", "aI"→"AI", "a I"→"AI". Check proper nouns - AI, API, Gartner, Nielsen must be capitalized correctly. **MANDATORY**: After writing, search entire article for lowercase proper nouns (gartner, nielsen) and capitalize them. Write professionally.

*** SOURCES ***

• MINIMUM {standards["citation_count"]} authoritative sources (aim for 20+ for deep research).
• Source quality hierarchy (prioritize in order):
  1. Academic research papers, peer-reviewed studies
  2. Government/regulatory bodies, industry associations
  3. Major research firms (Gartner, Forrester, McKinsey)
  4. Established media outlets (WSJ, Forbes, TechCrunch)
• Format: `[1]: https://… – 8-15 word description` (canonical URLs only).
• **CRITICAL**: Use SPECIFIC PAGE URLs, NOT domain homepages. Example: `https://example.com/research/2025-study` NOT `https://example.com`
• **CRITICAL**: Link sources IN-TEXT using anchor tags. Format: `<a href="https://source-url.com/page" target="_blank">relevant text</a> [1]` - embed links naturally within sentences.
• AVOID: blogs, generic websites, promotional content, domain homepages, opinion pieces.
• VERIFY: All sources must be current (within 2 years) and directly relevant. Check source dates.

*** HARD RULES ***

• HTML: Keep all tags intact (<p>, <ul>, <ol>, <h2>, <h3>, <strong>, <a>). Group sentences into coherent paragraphs; avoid excessive <p> tags per sentence.
• Meta_Title: REQUIRED - ≤55 chars SEO-optimized title.
• Meta_Description: REQUIRED - 100-110 chars with CTA (clear, actionable, grounded in company info).
• Headline: REQUIRED - 50-60 characters exactly. Count before finalizing.
• Intro: MAXIMUM 300 words total.
• All content in {language_name}.
• Never mention: {competitors_str}.
• Maximum 3 citations per section (if more facts, cite at end of paragraph).
• FINAL CHECK BEFORE OUTPUT:
  1. Count keyword "{primary_keyword}" mentions - must be 5-8 exactly (not 8-12 anymore)
  2. Count internal links - must be at least {standards["internal_links_min"]}
  3. Count statistics/data points - must be at least {standards["data_points_min"]}
  4. Count case studies - must be at least {standards["case_studies_min"]}
  5. Count specific examples - must be at least {standards["examples_min"]}
  6. Count unique insights - must be at least {standards["unique_insights_min"]}
  7. Search for "aI" or "a I" and replace with "AI"
  8. Search for lowercase proper nouns (gartner, nielsen) and capitalize
  9. Verify headline is 50-60 chars
  10. Check for banned generic phrases
  Common mistakes: applys→applies, simplifys→simplifies, enableing→enabling, aI→AI.

# Stage 2 Prompt Restructure - Complete

**Date:** December 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Restructured following industry standard (Context → Task → Output)

---

## 🎯 Industry Standard Applied

**Structure:** Context → Task → Output

1. **CONTEXT** - Role definition ("You are an expert...")
2. **OUTPUT FORMAT** - JSON structure (moved from #12 to #2)
3. **OUTPUT RULES** - PAA/FAQ separation rules
4. **CONTENT FORMATTING RULES** - All formatting rules (consolidated)
5. **VALIDATION CHECKLIST** - Final verification

**Task** comes from main prompt (Stage 1), so it's separate from system instruction.

4. If you cannot find information about the company, return an error field in the JSON
5. **CRITICAL: Find and analyze existing blog post images for visual style reference**

Analyze all retrieved information to provide:

1. Company basics (name, website, industry)

3. Target audience and ideal customers
4. Brand voice and tone
5. Key value propositions
6. Customer pain points they address
7. Common use cases
8. Content themes they focus on
9. Main competitors (based on industry and offerings)
10. **CRITICAL: A detailed voice_persona for content writing**
11. **CRITICAL: Visual identity for image generation**
12. **Blog authors (extract from existing blog articles)**

## VOICE PERSONA

The voice_persona is critical - it defines HOW to write content that RESONATES WITH THE TARGET AUDIENCE (ICP).

**CRITICAL: The voice must match what the ICP responds to, not just the company's brand voice.**

Consider the ICP (Ideal Customer Profile):
- Who are they? (role, seniority, technical level)
- What do they value? (speed, accuracy, innovation, ROI, simplicity)
- How do they consume content? (skim vs deep-read, mobile vs desktop)
- What tone resonates with them? (peer-to-peer, expert-to-learner, consultant-to-executive)
- What makes them trust content? (data, case studies, peer validation, credentials)

Examples of ICP-aligned voice:
- **ICP: CTOs/DevOps** → Direct, technical, code examples, benchmark data, "here's how it actually works"
- **ICP: Marketing Directors** → ROI-focused, competitive insights, "here's how to beat competitors"
- **ICP: Small Business Owners** → Practical, cost-conscious, "here's what you can do today"
- **ICP: Enterprise Procurement** → Risk mitigation, compliance, vendor comparison, "here's why this is safe"

The voice_persona must help writers AVOID robotic AI patterns like:
- Starting every section with "What is X?"
- Using "According to experts..." constantly
- Filler phrases like "In today's rapidly evolving landscape..."
- Over-hedging with "may", "might", "potentially"

## VISUAL IDENTITY (for Image Generation)

Analyze the website's visual design and existing blog images to extract:

1. **Brand Colors**: Extract primary and secondary colors as hex codes from the website design
2. **Visual Style**: Is it minimalist, bold, corporate, playful, technical, etc.?
3. **Design Elements**: What patterns do they use? (gradients, icons, illustrations, photos, abstract shapes)
4. **Typography Feel**: Modern sans-serif, classic serif, technical monospace, etc.
5. **Mood**: Professional, friendly, innovative, trustworthy, cutting-edge, etc.

**BLOG IMAGE EXAMPLES - CRITICAL:**
- Navigate to the company's blog/magazine section
- Find 3-5 existing blog post images (hero images, featured images)
- For each image, provide the URL and describe:
  - Visual style (photo, illustration, abstract, infographic)
  - Color palette used
  - Composition and layout
  - Any text overlays or design elements
  - The overall mood/feeling

Use these examples to create an `image_style_prompt` - a base prompt that can be used with AI image generation to create images matching the company's visual style.

## BLOG AUTHORS

Extract author information from existing blog articles:

1. Navigate to the company's blog/magazine section
2. Find 2-5 blog articles and look for author information
3. For each author found, extract:
   - Full name
   - Job title/role (if visible)
   - Short bio (if available on the page)
   - Profile image URL (if visible)
   - LinkedIn or Twitter/X links (if available)

**IMPORTANT:**
- Only include authors you can actually find on the website
- Do NOT make up or hallucinate author information
- If no author info is visible on articles, return an empty authors array
- Some blogs show "Company Name" as author - skip these, we want real people

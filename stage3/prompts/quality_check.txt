FIND AND FIX THESE ISSUES:

1. **Em-dashes (—)** - PRIORITY FIX:
   - Replace ALL em-dashes (—) with comma, period, or regular hyphen
   - Example: "the tool—which is powerful—works" → "the tool, which is powerful, works"

2. **AI Filler Phrases** - Remove entirely:
   - "In today's rapidly evolving..."
   - "In the ever-changing landscape of..."
   - "It's important to note that..."
   - "As we navigate..."
   - "Let's dive into..."
   - "When it comes to..."
   - "Here's how", "Here's what", "Here's why"
   - "Key points:", "Key takeaways:", "Important considerations:"

3. **Weak Sentence Starters** - Make more direct:
   - "There are many ways to..." → "[Specific thing] helps you..."
   - "It is essential to..." → State what's essential directly
   - "One of the most important..." → Name the important thing directly

4. **Promotional Fluff** - Tone down:
   - "revolutionary", "game-changing", "cutting-edge" → specific benefits
   - "unlock the power of" → "use"
   - "take your X to the next level" → specific improvement
   - "seamless", "robust", "comprehensive" → be specific instead

5. **Repetitive Patterns** - Vary structure:
   - Multiple sentences starting with "This..."
   - Overuse of "Additionally," "Furthermore," "Moreover,"
   - Every paragraph starting the same way

6. **Duplicate FAQ/PAA Questions** - Remove near-duplicates

7. **Generic Conclusions** - Delete these phrases:
   - "In conclusion..."
   - "To summarize..."
   - "As we've seen..."

8. **Stilted Corporate Speak**:
   - "utilize" → "use"
   - "leverage" → "use"
   - "facilitate" → "help"
   - "implement" → "set up" or "use"
   - "optimize" → "improve" (when overused)

9. **Outdated References** - Flag for review:
   - "recent report" without year → should specify current year
   - "recent study" without date

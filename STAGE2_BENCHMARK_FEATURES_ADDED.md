# Stage 2 Benchmark Features Added

**Date:** December 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ All features integrated into Stage 2 system instruction

---

## ✅ High Priority Features Added (Modified)

### 1. **Competitors Rule** ✅
**Location:** New section `=== BRAND PROTECTION RULES (CRITICAL) ===`

**Added:**
- NEVER mention competitor names in article content
- NEVER link to competing companies or their websites
- If comparison needed, use generic terms like "traditional solutions", "other platforms", "alternative approaches"
- Protects brand focus and prevents accidental competitor promotion

**Status:** Added as-is (clear prohibition)

---

### 2. **Paragraph Content Requirement** ⚠️ MODIFIED
**Location:** New subsection under `=== E-E-A-T REQUIREMENTS ===`

**Added:**
- Most paragraphs (70%+) should include specific metrics, examples, or data points
- Not every paragraph needs data (transitional paragraphs are fine), but most should
- Include: percentages, dollar amounts, timeframes, KPIs, real-world examples, case studies
- Ensures substance and credibility throughout the article

**Modification:** Changed from benchmark's "every paragraph" to "most paragraphs (70%+)" for flexibility

---

### 3. **Active Voice Preference** ⚠️ MODIFIED
**Location:** New section `WRITING STYLE REQUIREMENTS` after `=== CONVERSATIONAL TONE ===`

**Added:**
- Prefer active voice (aim for 70-80% of sentences)
- Active: "Organizations implement X" (preferred)
- Passive: "X is implemented by organizations" (use only when it improves clarity)
- Use passive voice when it's more natural or improves readability
- Makes content more engaging and direct

**Modification:** Changed from benchmark's "≥90%" to "aim for 70-80%" for natural writing

---

## ⚠️ Medium Priority Features Added (Flexible)

### 4. **Bridging Sentences** ⚠️ FLEXIBLE
**Location:** New subsection `SECTION TRANSITIONS (BRIDGING SENTENCES)` in section variety

**Added:**
- Use bridging sentences where they improve flow between sections
- Vary transition styles to avoid repetition (don't use the same phrase every time)
- Examples of varied transitions:
  - "Now that you understand X, let's explore Y..."
  - "Building on this foundation, we can examine..."
  - "With X in mind, consider how Y affects..."
  - "Having covered X, the next critical aspect is..."
- Not every section needs a bridging sentence - use them where they add value
- Avoid formulaic transitions that make all articles sound the same

**Modification:** Changed from benchmark's "end every section" to "where they improve flow" for flexibility

---

### 5. **Strong Tags** ⚠️ FLEXIBLE
**Location:** New subsection `STRONG TAGS USAGE` under `=== FORMAT RULES ===`

**Added:**
- Use <strong> tags sparingly for key insights, statistics, or important points
- Don't force emphasis if it doesn't add value
- Target: 1-2 <strong> tags per section when they highlight critical information
- Example: "<p>Data breaches cost organizations an average of <strong>$5.17 million</strong> per incident.</p>"

**Modification:** Changed from benchmark's rigid "1-2 per section" to "sparingly, when valuable" with flexible target

---

### 6. **Internal Links** ⚠️ FLEXIBLE
**Location:** New subsection `INTERNAL LINKS (OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED)` under `=== CITATION RULES ===`

**Added:**
- Include internal links where they add value and fit naturally
- Don't force links if they don't fit the content
- Internal links help with SEO and user navigation
- If you reference concepts covered in other sections, consider linking to them naturally

**Modification:** Made optional and flexible ("where they add value") rather than mandatory "one per section"

---

## 📊 Summary

### Features Added:
- ✅ **6 features** integrated into Stage 2 prompt
- ✅ **3 high priority** (competitors, paragraph content, active voice)
- ✅ **3 medium priority** (bridging sentences, strong tags, internal links)

### Philosophy Applied:
- ✅ **Flexibility over rigidity** ("most" vs "every", "aim for" vs "≥90%")
- ✅ **Natural writing** (passive voice allowed when better, transitions varied)
- ✅ **Value-driven** (links/emphasis only when they add value)

### Integration:
- ✅ All features integrated naturally into existing prompt structure
- ✅ No conflicts with existing rules
- ✅ Maintains our strengths (section variety, E-E-A-T, HTML structure)

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ **Test generation** with new prompt to verify features are followed
2. ✅ **Monitor output quality** for natural application of rules
3. ✅ **Adjust if needed** based on actual model behavior

---

## 📝 Notes

- All features use flexible language ("most", "prefer", "aim for", "where they add value")
- Benchmark's rigid requirements were softened to allow natural writing
- Competitors rule is the only strict prohibition (as intended)
- Internal links remain optional since Stage 5 handles them well

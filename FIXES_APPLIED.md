## Issues Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Stage 4 Citations Null Check

**Problem:** `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` when `context.company_data` is `None`

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Before:
if self.config.enable_citation_validation and context.company_data.get("company_url"):

# After:
if self.config.enable_citation_validation and context.company_data and context.company_data.get("company_url"):
```

**File:** `pipeline/blog_generation/stage_04_citations.py:139`

**Impact:** Stage 4 will no longer crash when `company_data` is missing

---

### ✅ Issue 2: Single Article Test Dict Access Error

**Problem:** `'dict' object has no attribute '__dict__'` when `validated_article` is already a dict

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Before:
elif hasattr(context.validated_article, 'model_dump'):
    article_dict = context.validated_article.model_dump()
else:
    article_dict = dict(context.validated_article.__dict__)

# After:
elif isinstance(context.validated_article, dict):
    article_dict = context.validated_article
elif hasattr(context.validated_article, 'model_dump'):
    article_dict = context.validated_article.model_dump()
elif hasattr(context.validated_article, '__dict__'):
    article_dict = dict(context.validated_article.__dict__)
else:
    article_dict = {}
```

**File:** `test_full_pipeline_deep_inspection.py:223-229`

**Impact:** Test will handle dict, Pydantic models, and objects correctly

### ✅ Issue 3: Academic Citations in Body Content

**Problem:** Academic citations `[N]` appearing in body content (8-10 instances)

**Fix Applied:**
Added final cleanup pass that removes `[N]` patterns from body content while preserving `[N]:` format in Sources section:

```python
# Split HTML into body and Sources section
sources_start = html.find('<section class="citations">')
if sources_start > 0:
    body_html = html[:sources_start]
    sources_html = html[sources_start:]
    
    # Remove [N] patterns from body only (not Sources section)
    # Pattern matches [N] but not [N]: (which is correct in Sources)
    body_html = re.sub(r'(?<!\[)\[\d+\](?!:)', '', body_html)
    
    html = body_html + sources_html
```

**File:** `pipeline/processors/html_renderer.py:450-463`

**Impact:** Academic citations will be removed from body content while preserving correct `[N]:` format in Sources section

## Understanding: 71.4% Full URLs

### What This Means

**Full URLs (Good):**
- `https://www.akamai.com/resources/state-of-the-internet/lurking-in-the-shadows`
- Points to specific page/article
- Better for SEO and credibility

**Domain-Only URLs (Less Good):**
- `https://www.akamai.com`
- Just the homepage
- Less specific, harder to verify

### Current Status

- **71.4% Full URLs** = 5 out of 7 citations are full URLs ✅
- **28.6% Domain-only** = 2 out of 7 citations are just domains ⚠️

### Is This an Issue?

- **71.4% is GOOD** (above 50% threshold)
- **100% would be IDEAL**
- Domain-only URLs suggest citation enhancement could be improved

### Why This Happens

- Gemini sometimes provides generic URLs (`domain.com`)
- Stage 4 citation validation should enhance these with full URLs
- Stage 4 was failing (now fixed) so enhancement wasn't happening

### Expected Improvement

After Stage 4 fix:
- Stage 4 will enhance domain-only URLs using grounding URLs from Google Search
- Should improve to **90-100% full URLs**

## Testing

All fixes are ready for testing. Run:

```bash
python3 test_full_pipeline_deep_inspection.py
```

Expected results:
- ✅ Stage 4 should not crash
- ✅ Single article test should pass
- ✅ Academic citations should be removed from body
- ✅ Citation quality should improve (more full URLs)

---

## Summary

**3 Critical Issues Fixed:**
1. ✅ Stage 4 null check
2. ✅ Test script dict access
3. ✅ Academic citations cleanup

**1 Performance Issue Identified:**
- Stage 2b taking 4-6 minutes (64-76% of total time)
- Optimization recommended but not blocking

**1 Quality Metric Explained:**
- 71.4% full URLs is good, will improve after Stage 4 fix
